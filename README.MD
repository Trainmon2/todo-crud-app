# To-Do App  

A PHP + HTML + CSS application that lets users log in by name, add and view their tasks, and remember their list across sessions.  
This project was my first step toward understanding how user state, form handling, and dynamic content come together in a real app.  

---

## 🧠 What It Does  
- Greets the user by name after login.  
- Lets the user add, view, and clear tasks.  
- Stores data using PHP sessions (future: database integration).  

---

## 💡 What I Learned  
- How to use **PHP sessions** to remember users and their data.  
- How to validate form input with **if statements**.  
- How to dynamically loop through and display stored data.  
- How **Flexbox** helps align form elements and task lists.  

---

## 🔧 Improvements / Next Steps  
- Add task-completion toggle and style for finished tasks.  
- Connect to a MySQL database to store tasks permanently.  
- Add filters (All | Active | Completed).  
- Build a dark-mode theme.
